# Dicee-JavaScript-Solution
This is my solution to the Boss Level Challenge 1 of The Complete 2023 Web Development Bootcamp by Angela Yu.

[See The Dice Roller Page Here](https://sentientcyborg.github.io/Dicee-JavaScript-Solution/)

For this challenge, we were provided with an html and css template and had to write the JavaScript functionality from scratch. My solution uses functions and differs significantly from the instructor's solution. I also made some small changes to the html/css files.
